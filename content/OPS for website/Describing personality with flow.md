Chapter title: 

[Keep everything brrief and simple and probably give more information on the right column of the page, preferably hidden first and if they want to they can open it so that they can understand the context better.

I also want this is to be set up page by page so that it is not overwhelming. I feel like it would be better if terms can be clarified by clicking them and the right column will shwo the definition, and all the terms are bolded which can is pressable for the definition

Animals are the most important part that made up your personality. You can see animals as being the very thing that decides and giving reasons as what made you act certain ways that is different from other people. It is basically 

Animals are your characters as a person, it is something that made who you are as a person. Imagine a wooden sculpture. If you were to add 'your own personal animals' into it, it is basically you as a person. 

Animals are made up of four which can be found in every person. They are sleep, consume, blast play. One part 

Imagine the class scenario where a teacher is teaching the class, and you as a student is taking in the information. There are two actions here, teaching and learning. These are the information side of people. Imagine another scenario. You are going for a hangout with your close friends at a cafe in the city. Each of you share your jokes, sometimes making a funnier jokes everytime the other said a joke. Then you got back home, recalling the fun you had with your friends, maybe even noticing that you might went overboard, that you might hurt someone's feeling and so on. There are two actions here 'bantering' and 'processing'. These are the energy side of people. These two parts, information and energy in which every person has two of each made up what a person is. You are basically a living human that acts on information or energy. But in every human, has one coin so confident that it is what people remember you as, and another, so underused that they have no confidence in using it and it is uncharacteristically unlike you. The former you do casually and unconsciously, and find it easier to do in comparison of people around you. And the latter, it feels so conscious and you can feel it physically in your body that it is something hard to do and you know it yourself that it is not something you do everyday.

To translate those in ops terms, teaching is blast, learning is consume, bantering is play, and processing is sleep. While the situation I described earlier shows when these terms play it, it does not encompass the whole meaning of the term.

Information side: It information going one way only
Consume: Taking in information. Example: Reading books, listening teachers talking (strictly listening, doesn't include asking questions which would mean play, making mental note from observing the structure of a chair)
Blast: Teaching information. Example: A teacher teaching in class, somebody's mom asking you to serve food for the guest, 

Energy side: It is energy management, that keeps circling  in a loop, inside of yourself, or between you and another person
Play: Discussing, debating, bantering with another person a or in a group: Example: making jokes, qna, debate
Sleep: It is self reflection of who you are as a person and becoming efficient. Example: journalling, recalling past mistakes and working on fixing it, meditation, 

WHO ARE YOU?
This is where OPS deviates from mbti. While mbti described you as only being 16 personality. Animals made it that you have 128 personality. Just to let you know that the animals are made up of the cognitive functions that you have learned earlier, or that you have learned during your mbti days. Every person has their very on self that they protrays on the world that keeps turn on most of the time. This is what people see you as. You can only be one of these: sleep. play, blast or consume. Who are you as a person? Are you the one who love to be a homebody and dislikes meeting people = sleep? Are you somebody who finds it easy to talk with lots of random people = play? Do you love asking people on what to do = Blast? Do you love reading books all day = consume? 

While functions is mbti land are strictly a pair of one perceiving (Si/Ni/Se/Oe) and one judgment function (Ti, Fi, Te, Fe) and they are also need to be opposite of each other in terms of introversion and extroversion (take note of the letter i and e after the letter S N T and F). Basically the introverted perceiving can only be paired with the extroverted judgment and extroverted perceiving can obly be with introverted judgement and vice versa. Introverted perceving +introverted judgmenet and extroverted judgement and exteroverted perceiving does not exist.

This is why it gives ops flexibility of the functions and not giving the rules for no reason that they should just be fixed. Instead of flexibility, personally I think that functions are free flowing just like magnets, one any part (perceiver) will always be attracted to anther any part (judgement) Imagine a slot machine, one side for perceiving function and another side for judgement function. When you pull on the lever, any of the four perceiving fucntion can be mix and match with any four of the judgement functions without following rules. From now on the term is translted to ops term, wherer perceiving is called observer, and judgement is called decider.

The reason it being called observer because...
The reason it being callled decider is because...
Extroverted decider for simplication called as De (decider is extroverted) and Di (Decider is introverted). Also oe (Observer is extroverted) and Di (Decider is introverted). D are just the superinten of decider fucntions and o is the super of the O function.

Back to who are you as a person, if you are a 'sleep' person, then you would have both introverted decider and observer, play have both extroverted decider and extroverted observer. Both doesn't exist in mbti, and they are called jumpers in ops, theoretically meaning that the second fucntions jumps to the third fucntions, and the thrid functions now becomes the second functions, but for me instead of jumping, I would understand it as being attracted to any part of the other. (still not strong enough because it doesn't explain the axis). Now the standard mbti definition is consumer and blaster, which is extroverted observer and introverted decider (IxxP, ExxP), and introverted observer and extroverted decider (IxxJ, ExxJ).

If you know who you are (although I wouldn't recommend because most likely you are wrong, trust me) then that is your savior. Savior is a term where you feel good doing the thing because you unconsciously find it easy doing it. It feels like selfish because you keep doing the thing and too much of it usually causes problems with you or the people around you. You also have a second savior, which are like a second part of you. The intersting thing about this is If you have a savior from the information, then the second part is automatically being the energy part of you. The arrangment can also be energy first and infromation second. So basically like I said earlier, every person needs one of each information and energy that keeps your life going. This leaves you with the other part of energy and ifnroatmion in the bottom two of your personality, which is now referrred as your demon, where the last animal would be called as the last animal which will disrupt your life every now and then, not until you consciously do something to fix it which most people only realizes by at the very end of their life, or some not resolved at all.
