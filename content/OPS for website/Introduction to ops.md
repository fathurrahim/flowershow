I am explaining this using a different perspective from the way the original OPS and ops members understand ops. By no means that the knowledge I am presenting are different, I am just using my way of understanding ops concept which I personally think are much easier and would help people to understand it better. It is my current understanding of ops as of now, if you have something to comment that some things might be misleading and wrong, feel free to email me here.
