Blast

Blast is using something that is known to help the tribe.

Blast is a function that is very people oriented. It uses knowledge that has been tested to be working and given to the tribe. it is just like preparing to teach somebody else, you need to have a set of rules of what to teach your student, what one topic or concept to teach, how to make the topic easy to grasp for all your student to undestand, and so forth. 

blasters what YOU TO LISTEN TO THEM because the information that they are giving is important for YOU, its not for them, but for you. But in your perspective, they are forcing in information that they repeatedly told you in the past, in the same tone, the same sentecne, the same content, the same way. And embarassingly enough, you overhead them telling the exact same information on otheer people, the exact same way that they have told you. That is blast. The information of blast is very basic, easy to understand, for you. It feels like they are the most right, and highly likely that they are right, and their intention is especially right, its just that the drawback of blast is that it lacks depth, it usually is too general. But the upside is its downside, it is digestible for everyone, it take less time to deliver hard concept, it is very practical, it is helpful. That is just how blast is and you cannot change that because that is how it is. If you one the exact oppposite of blast, then that is consume.

Blast is teaching, commanding, producing. Blast innermost core is one information for the whole tribe. So how does that translates to action we do everyday? The most visible one is teaching, you want to let everyone that you taught to have the same information as you do, the same undertanding as you do, so each individual has the same exact Oi information as everybody else (De). Commanding is also the same way, you want everybody to follow your direction. A much different action than the previous two are producing, where you put all of your known information into cleaning the house and prepare the meals so that they are benefited from the way you use your known information.

Behavior of blast:
it does things repeatedly, it wants to be larger than you so they are heard. The want to make things as easy as possible, as succinct as possible, as short and undertanable as possible, as general as possible, and as fast as possible. no time is wasted, no word wasted, its digestible

Blast in combination with other animals:
Blast is a going out function, by itself the information is going out then it dissipates. So to make full use of blast, you need to take in the information back. To do that you 


Its very, information from one person and using that for the tribe
Teaching - Giving Infomration understanable for the whole tribe
Commanding - Getting everyone's attention to be on the same page
Producing - Using known information to create something for the use of the whole tribe


Play

Play is testing something out with the tribe

This is the most freedom type of them all because it doesn't care of ANY consequences happening to them. It the most in  the moment animal, doing things altogether without thinking of consequences. Its joking with no hard feelings, laughing, screaming and shouting with friends, its relationship one the surface without hte existence of depths, its asking a question and getting an answer, with no personal attachment and opinion, its doing something new altogether with friends. It is living in the moment and being okay with the unexpected happening alongside the tribe. While blast is infomration and its one way, for play it has a give and take mechanism
